# A simple implementation of BlockchainðŸ”¥

This is a bare minimum implementation of the blockchain technology using TypeScript for educational purposes only.

configure the function inside the `index.ts` to configure the blockchain instance.

This repository is part of a tutorial in [Medium](https://ankan101.medium.com/f2f8ccc54892?source=friends_link&sk=d92968f468d4e607355c6f0363e3be74)

Clone this repository from the terminal by running `git clone https://github.com/ankanbag101/blockchain-demo/`

### 3. Open the Directory:

cd into the directory to run the program. Run `cd blockchain-demo`

### 4. Install Dependencies:

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

### 5. Run the program

Run `npm start` and the program will start executing with a usage instructions.

```

npm install
npm start
```

## Usage

### 1. To add a block to the blockchain:

### 6. To terminate the program

Enter `exit` in the prompt or hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>

```
Usage:
-> add sender_name receiver_name transfer_amount  # adds a block to blockchain with the given data
-> show                                           # shows the list of blocks available in the blockchain
-> tamper block_number                            # tampers with the block giver by the number
-> check                                          # validates the blockchain
-> help                                           # show this message
-> exit                                           # close the program
